2007-10-08 (version 3.2)
 * Change the default value of physical-line-slip-backward to nil (to
   be consistent with the default behavior of Emacs).

2007-05-24
 * Workaround for Emacs 22.1's buggy vertical-motion.

2006-03-12 (version 3.1)

2002-11-27
 * Hack for the Emacs 21.3's buggy vertical-motion.

2002-08-23
 * On a composite character,
   (progn (narrow-to-region (point) (point)) (vertical-motion 1))
   crashes Emacs 21.  A workaround for this is added.

2002-08-15
 * Replace physical-line-e21-1-backward-composite-char1.

2002-03-29 (version 3.0)
 * Returns to advice only.
 * Bugs of `vertical-motion' and `*-char' remain on Emacs 21.2,
   so minor-version check of workarounds are commented out.


2002-01-12 (version 2.6)
 * Bug fix: point did not move up by
   (physical-line-e21-win-sane-vertical-motion -1) when
   truncate-lines or truncate-partial-width-windows.

2002-01-08 (version 2.5)
 * New user variable physical-line-slip-backward.

2002-01-07
 * Unnecessary quotes to lambda expressions were removed.
 * New user variable physical-line-mode-string-alist.

2001-12-11
 * Robust physical-line-disable-keymap against keyboard-quit.

2001-11-29 (version 2.4)
 * 3 (precisely 2) shims are introduced; none, advice, and moderate.
   Advice was given up at version 2.0, but revives here as one of
   shims.

2001-11-27
 * physical-line-e21-1-win-sane-vertical-motion0 came to be fast
   when a logical line is long.
 * Own minor mode map is added at the end of minor-mode-map-alist
   not to hide other minor modes' keymaps.

2001-11-22 (version 2.3)
 * Bug fix: physical-line-e21-1-win-sane-vertical-motion0 could
   not correctly treat such a line as "...[physical-newline][eob]".

2001-11-22
 * Emacs 21.1's vertical-motion also has a bug in no-windows mode.
   A workaround for this is added.

2001-11-13 (version 2.2)
 * physical-line-mode-map-setup-hook is added.

2001-11-11 (version 2.1)
 * Support for variable pitch.  (This means "Not collapse with
   variable pitch", not "Point moves with consideration to pitch.")

2001-11-11
 * Emacs 21.1's forward-char, backward-char, delete-char, etc.
   seem not to treat a composite character as a unit.
   A workaround for this is added.

2001-11-10
 * Bug fix: physical-line-beginning-of-line and
   physical-line-end-of-line did not accept nil as an argument.
 * Bug fix: physical-line-e21-1-sane-vertical-motion0 acted
   differently from ideal (vertical-motion 0) when
   inhibit-field-text-motion is non-nil.

2001-11-10
 * physical-line-beginning-of-line and physical-line-end-of-line
   are added.

2001-11-06 (version 2.0)
 * Docstring of function physical-line-mode is fixed. (Since it
   is also used in M-x describe-mode.)


2001-11-05
 * Minor mode came to be utilized. (got rid of advice to
   line-move)
   - (setq next-line-add-newlines t) will meet your expectations.
   - Behavior of (next-line) and (previous-line) is not changed.
     Major modes which depend on behavior of these functions
     (e.g. dired) will work with physical-line-mode on.

2001-11-01 (vertion 1.3)
 * The special care for the bug of Emacs 21.1's vertical-motion is
   reimplemented.

2001-10-31
 * When making a new mode-line-format, default-value of
   mode-line-format is used as a seed. (instead of current local
   value)
 * Version 1.2 was also incomplete.  This is not yet fixed.

2001-10-30 (vertion 1.2)
 * The care of version 1.1 was incomplete.  On Emacs 21.1,
   vertical-motion is replaced after all.

2001-10-29 (version 1.1)
 * An adhoc care for a bug of Emacs 21.1's vertical-motion is
   added. (since Emacs 21.1 has released.)

2000-12-03  (version 1.0)
 * completely rewritten  (using advice)
 * All codes derived from vz.el are removed.
 * Cursor slipping when used with non-single-width characters is fixed.
 * Strange behavior at the right edge of a window is corrected.


2000-02-20
 * modified for Emacs 20

2000-01-28
 * from vz.el (ftp://ftp.st.ryukoku.ac.jp/pub/emacs-lisp/vzel/)
 * physical-line can be activated/inactivated
 * mode-line
